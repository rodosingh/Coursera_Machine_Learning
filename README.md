# Coursera_Machine_Learning
This contains all the programming assignments of course "Machine Learning" by Dr. Andrew Ng of Stanford.

There are total 11 weeks and each week has some programming assignment which is listed above week-wise.

And ***one important note(for matlab users)***, if you are facing any submission problem then it may be due to the latest version of Matlab you are using.

I've faced the same problem with R2019b version and I've made the required changes in submission.m file. Please have a look. For more reference visit **https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/481388-how-do-i-resolve** or **https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/481537-submitwithconfiguration-not-working-in-matlab-r2019b**.

Good Luck for this course!
